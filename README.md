# Automatic Door System in Unity

## Overview
This Unity project implements a simple automatic door mechanism. The door opens when the player approaches and closes when the player moves away. The system uses Unity's Collider component to detect the player's presence.

## Features
- Uses a **Collider Trigger** to detect the player.
- Smooth **door opening and closing** animation.
- Fully customizable for different door sizes and speeds.
- Works in **3D environments** with simple integration.

## How It Works
1. The door has a **Box Collider (Is Trigger enabled)**.
2. When the player enters the collider, the door **opens**.
3. When the player exits, the door **closes**.
4. The movement is controlled using **Lerp (Linear Interpolation)** in C#.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Add the Door to Your Scene
- Create a **door object** (Cube or 3D Model).
- Attach a **Box Collider** and enable **Is Trigger**.

### 2. Attach the Script
Create a C# script (e.g., `AutomaticDoor.cs`) and attach it to the door:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class AutomaticDoor : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform door;
    public Vector3 openPosition;
    private Vector3 closedPosition;
    public float speed = 2f;
    private bool isOpening = false;

    void Start()
    {
        closedPosition = door.position;
    }

    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            isOpening = true;
        }
    }

    void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            isOpening = false;
        }
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (isOpening)
            door.position = Vector3.Lerp(door.position, openPosition, Time.deltaTime * speed);
        else
            door.position = Vector3.Lerp(door.position, closedPosition, Time.deltaTime * speed);
    }
}
```

### 3. Configure in Unity
- Assign the **door transform** in the script's inspector.
- Set `openPosition` to the position where the door should move when opening.
- Adjust the `speed` for faster or slower movement.
- Make sure the **Player GameObject** has a **Collider** and is tagged as `Player`.

## Future Improvements
- Add **sound effects** for opening/closing.
- Implement **sliding doors**.
- Add an **animation-based** door system.
